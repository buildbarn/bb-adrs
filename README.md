# Buildbarn Architecture Decision Records

This repository contains a set of
[Architecture Decision Records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record)
that apply to Buildbarn. The idea is that every time we make a
large-scale change to Buildbarn, we add an article to this repository
that explains the reasoning behind it.

These articles don't act as user documentation, but at least explain the
reasoning that went into designing some of Buildbarn's features. They
are also not updated over time, meaning that each of the articles is
written in the context of what Buildbarn looked like at the time.
